:toc: macro

An opinionated Eclipse JDT-based Java source code formatter.

toc::[]

== Goals

* 🚫​⚙️ No config file by default
  ** ship a sane default config, similar to https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format[palantir-java-format].
* 🪞 idempotent operation
  ** do not do other/additional changes upon subsequent reformat operations
* 📝 reading and writing
  ** allows output on stdout or overwriting the input files
* 🚯 no AST loss
  ** do not swallow comments, intentional empty lines and line breaks, etc.
* 🚀 FAST
  ** The project aims to create a GraalVM-based binary for most architectures, so it can operate
     almost as fast as `gofmt` or similar tools.

== Implementation

* 💻 Uses PicoCLI for command line parsing
* 📝 Uses Eclipse JDT for formatting
* ⚙️ Uses GraalVM for creating native, statically-linked stand-alone binaries

== The name

Why not call it `javafmt`?::
The JAVA® brand name is a registered trademark of Oracle, and except in limited circumstances, may not be used without a
written license from Oracle.
The “Java” name may be used in product, service, and event names without permission only in specific, limited ways.
+
… also, I wanted to keep the book open for the OpenJDK community to adopt an official tool with this name.

== Implementation status

Not started

== Compiling

* Use Maven 4 or the Maven wrapper
* JDK 21 required
