== Goals

* üö´‚Äã‚öôÔ∏è No config file by default
  ** ship a sane default config, similar to https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format[palantir-java-format].
* ü™û idempotent operation
  ** do not do other/additional changes upon subsequent reformat operations
* üìù reading and writing
  ** allows output on stdout or overwriting the input files
* üöØ no AST loss
  ** do not swallow comments, intentional empty lines and line breaks, etc.
* üöÄ FAST
  ** The project aims to create a GraalVM-based binary for most architectures, so it can operate
     almost as fast as `gofmt` or similar tools.

== Implementation

* üíª Uses PicoCLI for command line parsing
* üìù Uses Eclipse JDT for formatting
* ‚öôÔ∏è Uses GraalVM for creating native, statically linked stand-alone binaries

== FAQ

Why not call it `javafmt`?::
The JAVA¬Æ brand name is a registered trademark of Oracle, and except in limited circumstances, may not be used without a
written license from Oracle.
The ‚ÄúJava‚Äù name may be used in product, service, and event names without permission only in specific, limited ways.
+
‚Ä¶ also, I wanted to keep the book open for the OpenJDK community to adopt an official tool with this name.

How opinionated is it?::
While there is a default rule, you can use other named rules or even foreign config files created by Eclipse IDE as well.
But I encourage everyone to use the default configuration ‚Äì and let's discuss how well it is defined in the GitHub discussions and the issue tracker.

== Implementation status

Started.
The project is in an early stage and is not considered stable or feature-complete yet.

== Compiling

* Use Maven 4 or the Maven wrapper
* JDK 21 required

You can use `mvn verify` to create a tested and verified runnable application archive using jreleaser.
You can find and execute the archive in the path `cli/target/jreleaser/assemble/jdtfmt/java-archive`.
More info about these kinds of archives can be found in my blog post: https://blog.bmarwell.de/2025/04/12/creating-app-distribution-using-maven-jreleaser.html[Creating an App Distribution with Apache Maven and JReleaser].

Please note that Java 21 or better needs to be installed on your system and must be in the `PATH` environment variable.

=== Native Binaries

Why use native binaries?
Because they are fast, small, and do not require a JRE to be installed on the system.

Here is a simple comparison of this project running with both options:

----

As you can see, the native binary is about three times faster than the JAR distribution.

==== Compiling native binaries on linux

By default, a profile `dist-linux` is activated, which will create a native binary for Linux x86_64 using musl.
If you do not have musl and `libz.a` installed, you can use the profile `'-Pnative,!dist-linux'` to create a native binary using glibc instead.
